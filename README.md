## 1. Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
The decision to develop the program in a mostly static manner was driven by simplicity, given the absence of explicit constraints requiring exclusive dynamic data allocation. This choice facilitates a clearer understanding of the code structure.

## 2. Data Preparation <a name="data-preparation"></a>
Before delving into task-solving, data is meticulously prepared for processing. The program reads the number of nodes, edges, and deposits. Subsequently, it processes rows containing start nodes (u), arrival nodes (v), and costs (w). The adjacency matrix (g), its copy (gr), and the cost matrix (a) are constructed based on the read data. The program then handles deposits and requirements, categorizing each request type.

## 3. Task e1 <a name="task-e1"></a>
For task e1, a modified version of Dijkstra's algorithm is employed twice â€“ once for the outgoing route and another for the return route. The visited nodes are stored in a vector, reversed for further processing. The program displays the nodes, costs from source to destination, and return costs. A secondary Dijkstra iteration is performed to display nodes and calculate associated costs.

## 4. Task e2 <a name="task-e2"></a>
Task e2 diverges from common approaches, presenting a unique solution. Each deposit is systematically removed from the graph, and a traversal function is applied to traverse nodes related to each deposit. The resulting connected components are displayed, emphasizing a distinctive methodology.

## 5. Task e3 <a name="task-e3"></a>
In task e3, a personalized solution is implemented. The program reads the number of routes, nodes in each component, and the actual nodes for each route. A matrix is created, tracking visited nodes and accumulating costs. The program systematically calculates costs for each deposit, ensuring a comprehensive repair strategy for related components.
